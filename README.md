# RsClass

RsClass is a rust-based project aiming to be an alternative and upgrade to ReClass
and other game-hacking tools like it.

This is mainly a learning project so do not expect great functionnalities or
code practice, even though the goal has quite the remakable features!

## Quick description

- GUI based app.
- Open processes and analyze their memory.
- Create structures and visualize their data.
- Export the definition of the created structures.

## Intended Features

- "Custom" types, which do not create signatures.
- Ghidra-like search for types.
- Able to parse ghidra DB files to load types.
- Parsing of debug files to help the process.

## License

For now, no license.
