# RsClass

RsClass is a rust-based project aiming to be a Rust-based alternative to [ReClassEx](https://github.com/ajkhoury/ReClassEx), while keeping most of its functionnalities.

As it stands, this is still a learning project and does not reflect good code 
practices.

Any discussion on the project is welcome!
